In this project, I performed end-to-end customer churn analysis using Python.
I cleaned and analyzed the data, encoded categorical variables, and applied Logistic Regression for churn prediction.
The model performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Feature importance analysis helped identify key factors influencing customer churn.
This project demonstrates my understanding of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.
Ans runnig This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior to identify key factors that lead to customer attrition.
Using data analysis techniques and Power BI, an interactive dashboard is created to help businesses understand churn patterns and take data-driven retention decisions.
